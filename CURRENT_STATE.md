# Current State

## Active Specs

- None. This repository is the reusable bootstrap package, not a product
  implementation project.

## Active Architecture

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` defines the stack-neutral bootstrap architecture.

## Active ADRs

- None. `ADR/ADR_INDEX.md` is initialized and ready for project-specific
  decisions.

## Active Implementation Phase

- Shared AI role system for Claude, Codex, and other coding agents added to the
  reusable bootstrap scaffold and validated.
- Fresh adversarial review of the shared role update requested changes; P1 and
  P2 fixes have been implemented and are ready for fresh re-review.
- Baseline commit requested; pre-commit hook self-scan false positive fixed and
  validation passed; baseline commit created on `main`.

## Active Branch

- `main`

## Active Worktree

- `/Users/ahmedabd/Desktop/AI Projects/New Poject bootstrap`

## Active Backlog Focus

- Bootstrap package completeness, shared agent role consistency, and
  validation.

## Current Blockers

- No product-specific input has been provided for a downstream software
  project.

## Current Source-Of-Truth Files

- `AI_PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `GOVERNANCE.md`
- `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`
- `memory/ai/SHARED_AGENT_RULES.md`
- `memory/ai/ROLE_*.md`
- `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY.md`
- `TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `BACKLOG.md`
- `BRANCH_AND_WORKTREE_GUIDE.md`
- `PR_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `RISK_MODEL.md`

## Known Stale Or Superseded Files

- None in this bootstrap package at initialization.

## Next Recommended Action

Run fresh adversarial re-review when desired, then create the first product
spec from product input.

## Latest Validation

- `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh` passed on 2026-05-09.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` passed on 2026-05-09.
- `.githooks/pre-push` passed on 2026-05-09.
- Post-review validation passed after registry, validator, hook, input
  directory, merge policy, and handoff fixes.
- Governance metadata exception for `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` documented and
  validated on 2026-05-09.
- Git repository initialized on `main`.
- Local hook path configured to `.githooks`.
- Focused shared-role required-file check failed before the role files and
  Claude helper existed, as expected for the new requirement.
- `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh` failed until the new role files and
  Claude helper were registered in `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY.md`.
- `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh` passed after the shared role system,
  Claude helper, registry, traceability, and docs were aligned.
- `bash -n SCRIPTS/start-claude.sh && bash -n SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`
  passed on 2026-05-09.
- Shared role adversarial review reran `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`,
  `bash -n SCRIPTS/start-claude.sh`, and
  `bash -n SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`; all passed, but review decision is
  request changes.
- Shared role review fixes added a durable PR review package and documented
  default Claude mode as orientation-only.
- After review fixes, `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`,
  `bash -n SCRIPTS/start-claude.sh`, and
  `bash -n SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh` passed on 2026-05-09.
- Commit preparation validation: `bash SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`,
  `bash -n .githooks/pre-commit && bash -n SCRIPTS/start-claude.sh && bash -n
  SCRIPTS/validate-bootstrap.sh`, and `.githooks/pre-commit` passed on
  2026-05-09 after fixing the pre-commit hook scanner self-match.
